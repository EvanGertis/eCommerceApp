# Node.js Stripe Shopping Cart

In this repository you will find all the code for setting up Stripe payments with a shopping cart. A lot of this code was taken from the webDev simplified tutorial found here: [here](https://youtu.be/mI_-1tbIXQI). I stripped out a lot of stuff and fixed the links to different files.
